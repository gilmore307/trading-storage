# Decision


## D001 - Storage owns persistence policy, not artifact semantics

Date: 2026-04-25

### Context

The trading platform needs `trading-storage` to have a clear owner boundary before implementation begins.

### Decision

Storage defines where and how durable outputs live; producing repositories still own the semantic contents of their artifacts.

### Rationale

A narrow component boundary prevents hidden coupling and keeps cross-repository work reviewable.

### Consequences

- Implementation work must stay inside the accepted component role.
- Shared names and contracts must route through `trading-main`.
- Generated outputs and secrets must stay out of Git.


## D002 - Generated artifacts stay out of Git

Date: 2026-04-25

### Context

The trading platform needs `trading-storage` to have a clear owner boundary before implementation begins.

### Decision

Runtime data, artifacts, archives, and backups must not be committed to the repository.

### Rationale

A narrow component boundary prevents hidden coupling and keeps cross-repository work reviewable.

### Consequences

- Implementation work must stay inside the accepted component role.
- Shared names and contracts must route through `trading-main`.
- Generated outputs and secrets must stay out of Git.


## D003 - Restore expectations are first-class

Date: 2026-04-25

### Context

The trading platform needs `trading-storage` to have a clear owner boundary before implementation begins.

### Decision

Backup, restore, archive, and rehydrate policy must be defined before storage becomes critical infrastructure.

### Rationale

A narrow component boundary prevents hidden coupling and keeps cross-repository work reviewable.

### Consequences

- Implementation work must stay inside the accepted component role.
- Shared names and contracts must route through `trading-main`.
- Generated outputs and secrets must stay out of Git.
